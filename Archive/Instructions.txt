This script is an extension of the Randomizer tool in FL Studio. It randomizes note start time, velocity, and more, and also allows for randomizing note pitch in multi-sample instruments like Kontakt Drum library. It ensures that notes do not overlap or extend past the desired looping pattern length. The script includes a video demonstration of randomizing drum programming. Feedback and issue reports are welcome.
